[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]

You really thought you[N]

could slip out from under[N]

me just like that?[A]

[Right][TwoLineBox]

But of course, how[N]

hard could it be?[A]

[MidLeft][CloseEyes]

Hmph.[......][OpenEyes] Your blasted rebellion[N]

has been a thorn in my side[AN]

long enough.[....] I'm putting an[N]

end to this pointless conflict[AN]

here and now,[....] today.[A]

[FarRight][ThreeLineBox]

Cidor! Don't you see the[N]

harm this is doing to our[N]

country? Why do you-[A]

[MidLeft]

Enough of your political drivel,[N]

you don't even understand what[N]

you're fighting against. I do[AN]

what I must for Decia.[A]

[FarRight]

Even if that amounts to killing[N]

your own countrymen? Letting[N]

Cythes stomp all over us?[AN]

Just that you might become[N]

their favourite pet?[A]

[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]

You know nothing of what[N]

I work towards, why I do this.[N]

But enough Kasun, this ends[AN]

here. Your 'liberation'[N]

shall fall with you![A]

[FarRight]

Pah, like I'd fall to a[N]

traitorous swine like you![A][X]
