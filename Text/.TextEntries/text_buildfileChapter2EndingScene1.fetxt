Dragana![A]

[MidRight][TwoLineBox]

Well, well, well. Aren't you[N]

two a sight for sore eyes.[A]

[MidLeft][OneLineBox]

It's good to see you well, General.[A]

[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]

As if a spineless fop like Cibor could[N]

break me. That being said, though,[N]

this cell isn't exactly pleasant.[AN]

Let's get out of here, yeah?[A]

Y-Yes, General?[A]

[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]

Good job, seriously. I knew I[N]

made the right decision making[N]

you and Loewe my adjutants.[AN]

Ha! Fate's got another thing[N]

coming if it thinks it'll be[N]

You may wish to rethink that, general.[A]
