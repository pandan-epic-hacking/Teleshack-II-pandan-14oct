If we can get through here,[N]

we should be able to[N]

make a break for it.[A]

[FarRight][OneLineBox]

You're sure about this Varga?[A]

[Right][TwoLineBox]

Not exactly, there will[N]

be plenty of guards.[A]

[FarLeft][ThreeLineBox]

You're sure we can trust this guy[N]

Cleo? I mean he was awful keen[N]

to turn on his former allies.[A]

[FarRight][TwoLineBox]

I'm certain, trust me on this.[N]

I'll explain it all later.[A]

[FarLeft][ThreeLineBox]

Yeah, I trust you, alright then.[N]

Well I think no matter what we do[N]

we're going to run into soldiers,[AN]

so I don't see anything wrong[N]

with Varga's proposal. General?[A]

[Left]

If we can get the drop on them we[N]

should be able to push through[N]

before they can react,[AN]

but we'll have to be fast if we[N]

want everyone to escape. Of course[N]

that should be no trouble for us.[A]

[FarRight][TwoLineBox]

Alright then, if theres no[N]

objections, lets move.[A][X]
